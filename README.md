# Nanahira language
maybe you're thinking "a compiler, written in javascript? really? are you stupid?", and yeah but:
* once the shits compiled runtime is the same, and i plan on making compilation zoomzoom fast
* i plan on rewriting the compiler in this language once its ready

so what does it support? at the moment, jack all (that would be useful to you anyway), but heres the list anyway:
* lexing
* parsing
  * variable assignments
  * function declarations
  * expressions

code generation coming soon?

Coming up with a name is too hard so named after our queen ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
